# clock-wise or Heisema Zeidozeiga
The Heisema Zeidozeiga displays the time in the wording of dialect Heisemarisch (Leutershausen an der Bergstra√üe near Heidelberg). It has special functions such as automatic brightness adjustment or automatic reception of the time by decoding the long-wave DCF-77 signal from Mainfingen near Frankfurt.

A project with a AtMega1284P programmed in C displays the local time with a 12x12 led matrix. For details see german documentation [file](Docu/Zeidozeiga_Dokumentation_003.docx).

This is a present for my dad's 60th birthday.
